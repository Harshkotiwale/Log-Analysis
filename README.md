Log Analysis
This Python-based log analysis script processes server log files to generate insights including IP address request counts, the most frequently accessed endpoint, and detection of suspicious activities such as failed login attempts. The script outputs the analysis results in a formatted text output and saves them in a CSV file.

Features
IP Address Request Count: Counts the number of requests made by each IP address.
Most Frequently Accessed Endpoint: Identifies the most frequently accessed endpoint in the log file.
Suspicious Activity Detection: Detects IPs with multiple failed login attempts and flags them as suspicious.
